## Project Overview

The **"Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table"** competition, hosted by DrivenData, aims to enhance 
access to clean water in Tanzania by predicting the operational status of water pumps. Participants are 
tasked with developing models to classify waterpoints into three categories:

- **Functional**: The waterpoint is operational and requires no repairs.
- **Functional Needs Repair**: The waterpoint is operational but needs maintenance.
- **Non-Functional**: The waterpoint is not operational.

Utilizing data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, I aim to create predictive models that 
can effectively determine the status of these waterpoints. Accurate predictions will aid in optimizing 
maintenance efforts, ensuring that communities across Tanzania have reliable access to potable water.
